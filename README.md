# Odin Recipes

## Project Overview

This project is a simple recipe website featuring common dishes found in the Philippines. It showcases traditional Filipino recipes with detailed ingredient lists and step-by-step cooking instructions. The project demonstrates fundamental HTML structure and semantic markup using only plain HTML without CSS styling.
