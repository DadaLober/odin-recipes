    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p class="text-highlight"><strong>Kinilaw na Isda</strong> is a traditional Filipino raw fish salad made by marinating fresh fish in vinegar and/or citrus juices, then mixing it with ginger, onions, chili, and sometimes coconut milk.
    It is one of the Philippines' oldest and most indigenous culinary preparations, with deep roots in pre-colonial food traditions.</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb fresh tanigue (Spanish mackerel) or tuna, cubed</li>
        <li>1 cup cane vinegar or coconut vinegar</li>
        <li>1 small red onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 thumbs ginger, minced</li>
        <li>2-3 bird's eye chilies (siling labuyo), sliced</li>
        <li>1 cucumber, diced (optional)</li>
        <li>Juice of 4-5 calamansi or 1 lemon</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup coconut cream (optional, for a regional variation)</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Clean the fish:</strong> Rinse fish cubes under cold water and pat dry. Make sure it's very fresh.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Quick cure:</strong> Place the fish in a bowl with vinegar. Let it sit for 2-3 minutes, then drain (this step helps "clean" the fish and begins the curing).</li>
        
        <li><strong>Mix aromatics:</strong> In another bowl, combine onions, ginger, chilies, and cucumber (if using).</li>
        
        <li><strong>Marinate:</strong> Add fish to the aromatic mix. Pour calamansi or lemon juice over it. Stir well and marinate for 10-15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Optional coconut cream:</strong> For a creamier version (common in southern Philippines), mix in coconut cream just before serving.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve chilled as an appetizer or with steamed rice for a full meal.</li>
    </ol>
